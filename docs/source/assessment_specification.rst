Overview
========
A PRISMH Assessment Document is a standard means to represent a set of values
that fulfill the requirements described in a corresponding Instrument
Definition.


Format
======
Assessment Documents are stored and exchanged as `JSON`_ (JavaScript Object
Notation) objects. The structure of these objects must adhere to the rules set
forth in this document.

.. _`JSON`: http://json.org/


Structure
=========

Root Object
-----------
The Root Object of an Assessment Document consists of several properties:

``instrument``
    :Type: `Instrument Reference Object`_
    :Constraints: Required
    :Description: This property specifies which Instrument Definition the
                  values contained within this Assessment Document
                  correspond to.

``meta``
    :Type: `Metadata Collection Object`_
    :Description: This property allows arbitrary information about the
                  Assessment to be stored within the document. This property is
                  optional.

``values``
    :Type: `Value Collection Object`_
    :Constraints: Required
    :Description: This property contains the values for the Fields defined
                  in the associated Instrument Definition.


Instrument Reference Object
---------------------------
An Instrument Reference Object is the means for an Assessment Document to
reference the exact Instrument (and version of that Instrument) that the
values contained within are in reference to.

``id``
    :Type: String
    :Constraints: Required; Must be a URI as described in `RFC3986`_

                  .. _`RFC3986`: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986
    :Description: This property is a reference to the `id` property on the root
                  object of an Instrument Definition. It is meant to specify
                  the exact Instrument this Assessment Document is in response
                  to.

``version``
    :Type: String
    :Constraints: Required
    :Description: This property is a reference the the `version` property on
                  the root object of an Instrument Definition. It is meant to
                  specify the exact revision of the Instrument this Assessment
                  Document is in response to.


Value Collection Object
-----------------------
A Value Collection Object consists of one to many properties where the
property name serves as a reference to the ID of a Field defined in the
associated Instrument, and the value of that property is a `Value Object`_
which contains the actual value for the Field.

This object must contain a property for *every* Field Object defined in the
corresponding Field Collection Object in the Instrument Definition.


Value Object
------------
A Value Object contains a value for a Field on an Instrument.

``value``
    :Constraints: Required
    :Description: This property contains the main value for the Field. If
                  there is no value for the Field, the value for this
                  property should be null. This non-response indication should
                  be used for all data types (e.g., don't use an empty string
                  for ``text`` data types, or empty arrays for
                  ``enumerationSet`` or ``recordList`` data types).
    :Type: Dependent on the type defined by the corresponding Field Object
           in the Instrument Definition. See following table:

           ==================  ===================  ===========

           time                String               Must be an `ISO 8601`_ extended format time (HH:MM:SS)

           .. _`ISO 8601`: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601

``explanation``
    :Type: String
    :Description: This property contains the additional explanation text for a
                  response, if any was provided.

``annotation``
    :Type: String
    :Description: This property contains the additional annotation text for a
                  response, if any was provided.

``meta``
    :Type: `Metadata Collection Object`_
    :Description: This property allows arbitrary information about the
                  value to be stored within the document. This property is
                  optional.


Value Collection Mapping
------------------------
A Value Collection Mapping consists of one to many properties where the
property name serves as a reference to the ID of a Row Object defined in the
associated Matrix Field, and the value of that property is a `Value Collection
Object`_ which contains the value(s) for the associated Column Objects.

This object must contain a property for *every* Row Object defined in the
corresponding Matrix Field Object in the Instrument Definition. The embedded
Value Collection Objects must contain a property for *every* Column Object from
the corresponding Matrix Field Object.


Metadata Collection Object
--------------------------
A Metadata Collection Object consists of one to many properties that allows you
to attach arbitrary, implementation-specific, or other such data to structures
within an Assessment Document.

For consistency's and interoperability's sake, some common data elements are
defined below, but note that the Metadata Collection Object has no required or
predefined properties, and can therefore contain any (legal JSON) property
names and value data types. Software that consumes Assessment Documents *must*
ignore any property whose name it does not recognize or support.
