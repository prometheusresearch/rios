RIOS Change History
*******************


0.2.0 (2015-xx-xx)
==================

* Changed name of standard to RIOS - Research Instrument Open Standard
* Removed ability to define Calculations with result types of ``enumeration``
  or ``enumerationSet``, as those types don't make sense without first defining
  the set of possible enumerations.
* Clarified that Form Element Tags cannot be the same as Page IDs or Instrument
  Field IDs.


0.1.0 (2015-08-24)
==================

* Initial publication of PRIMSH for review.
