RIOS - Research Instrument Open Standard

Overview
========

This repository contains the source materials needed to produce the RIOS
documentation site and specifications.


Contributing
============

Contributions to the RIOS specifications or this site specifically must be
made by forking this repository, implementing your desired changes, and then
submitting a Pull Request back to the project.

This site/specification is authored using the `reStructuredText`_ format within
a `Sphinx`_ site configuration.

.. _`reStructuredText`: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html
.. _`Sphinx`: http://sphinx-doc.org/

If you're working in a `Python`_-capable environment, you can install the
recommended toolset by using ``pip`` to install the ``requirements.txt`` file
that is included in this repository.

.. _`Python`: https://www.python.org/

Assuming the reccommended toolset is available, the full RIOS site can be
generated by executing ``make html`` within the ``/docs/`` directory in this
repository. The output will be placed in ``/docs/build/html``.
